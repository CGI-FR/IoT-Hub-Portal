# Concepts

The Azure IoT Hub portal inherit from Azure IoT Hub concepts for mananing IoT devices.

Inside the Portal, the solution leverage the following concepts:

- IoT Device Provisioning
- IoT Hub Device Twin
- IoT Hub Device Twin Properties
- IoT Hub Edge deployment manifest

## Device models

By using this capability, the application can create logical representation of IoT devices. This feature is designed to configure a set of sharable properties between devices. 
When creating a device, the user is prompted to specify the device model. The application will then apply the properties of the device model to the device.

### Parameters

* ``Device Model Id``: The ID of the device model.
> Note: Since the device model is shared among all the devices, the ID should be unique. For convinience, the ID is generated by the application. By sing the API, the ID is not required, if provided, it will be used as the ID of the device model.
* ``Name``: The name of the device model.
* ``Description``: The description of the device model.

### Built-in models

Built-in models are predefined device models that can be used by the application. 
This functionnality is exactly the same as standard device models except that the properties are not editable and the device model is not deletable.

> Note: Create and update a Built-in models are not available in the portal. They can be managed on through the Azure IoT Hub portal APIs.
> 
> see [Device Model API reference]( ./open-api.md#tocS_DeviceModel) for more information.

## Devices

Devices are the physical IoT devices that are provisioned by the application. They are represented by an object that is stored in the Azure IoT Hub as the device twin.

### Parameters

* ``Device Id``: The ID of the device.
> Note: Device id the same as the device id stored in the Azure IoT Hub. It is prompte to the user when creating a device and is not editable after the device is created.
* ``Name``: The name of the device model.
> Note: The device name, is the device friendly name. The name is editable after the device is created.
* ``Device Model``: The device model that the device is based on.
> Note: The device model is prompte to the user during the device creation and is not editable after the device is created.
* ``Status``: The status of the device.
> Note: The status is related to the 

### Device Twin tags

To store additional information about the device, the application uses device twin tags.

|------------	|-----------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| deviceName 	| tags.deviceName 	| Field that contains the device friendly name.<br>_**note**: if not set, the portal will show the device id instead of the device name until its configured._ 	|
| modelId    	| tags.modelId    	| Field that contains the device model identifier that the device is related.<br>_**note**: if not set, the device is not usable on the IoT hub portal._       	|
| deviceType 	| tags.deviceType 	| Field that contains a human readable device type (ex: 'LoRa Device')                                                                                         	|
