# Core Concepts

The Azure IoT Hub portal inherits from Azure IoT Hub concepts to manage IoT devices.

It relies on the following concepts:

- IoT Device Provisioning
- IoT Hub Device Twin
- IoT Hub Device Twin properties
- IoT Hub Edge deployment manifest
- Cloud To Device Message

## Device models

By using this capability, the application can create logical representations of IoT devices. This feature is designed to configure a set of sharable properties between devices. 
When creating a device, the user is asked to specify the device model. The application will then apply the properties of the device model to the device.

![./assets/images/device-model.png](./assets/images/device-model.png)

### Parameters

* ``Device Model Id``: The ID of the device model.
> Note: Since the device model is shared among all the devices, the ID should be unique. For convenience, the ID is generated by the application. By using the API, the ID is not required, but if provided, it will be used as the ID of the device model.
* ``Name``: The name of the device model.
* ``Description``: The description of the device model.

### Built-in models

Built-in models are predefined device models that can be used by the application. 
This functionnality is exactly the same as standard device models except that **the properties are not editable and the device model is not deletable** via the Portal.

> Note: Creating and updating built-in models is not available in the portal. They can be managed using the Azure IoT Hub portal APIs.
> 
> See [Device Model API reference]( ./open-api.html#tocS_DeviceModel) for more information.

## Devices

Devices are the physical IoT devices that are provisioned by the application. They are represented by an object that is stored in the Azure IoT Hub as the device twin.

![./assets/images/device-twin.png](./assets/images/device-twin.png)

### Parameters

* ``Device Id``: The ID of the device.
> Note: It is the device id stored in the Azure IoT Hub. It is asked to the user when creating a device and is not editable after the device is created.
* ``Name``: The name of the device model.
> Note: The device name is the device friendly name. The name is editable after the device is created.
* ``Device Model``: The device model that the device is based on.
> Note: The device model is asked to the user during the device creation and is not editable after the device is created.
* ``Status``: The status of the device.
> Note: The status is related to the Device status in the Azure IoT Hub.

### Device Twin tags

To store additional information about the device, the application uses device twin tags.

| Name       	| Position        	| Description                                                                                                                                                  	|
|------------	|-----------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| deviceName 	| ``tags.deviceName`` 	| Field that contains the device friendly name.<br>_**note**: if not set, the portal will show the device id instead of the device name until it's configured._ 	|
| modelId    	| ``tags.modelId``    	| Field that contains the device model identifier that the device is related.<br>_**note**: if not set, the device is not usable on the IoT hub portal._       	|
| supportLoRaFeatures | ``tags.supportLoRaFeatures`` | Field that specifies if the device must support LoRa features.<br>_**note**: if not set, LoRa features will be available on the device._       	|

## IoT Edge

IoT Edge is fully herited from Azure IoT Hub concepts. In the portal, the user can mangage the IoT Edge devices stored in Azure IoT Hub.
For more information about Azure IoT Edge, see [Azure IoT Edge documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/).

![./assets/images/iot-edge.png](./assets/images/iot-edge.png)

### Parameters

* ``Type``: The type of the IoT Edge device.
> Note: related to the IoT Edge purpose tag value that might be used to create deployment manifests.
* ``Environment``: The IoT Edge device environment (Development, Production, QA).
> Note: this is an additional field that can be used to create deployment manifests.
* ``Status``: The status of the device.
> Note: The status is related to the Device status in the Azure IoT Hub.
* ``Nbr of connected devices``: The number of devices connected to the IoT Edge device.
> Note: The number of connected devices is related to the number of connections that are currently present in the edgeHub module. This might be different from the number of devices connected to the IoT Edge device if some modules are using edgeHub connections.
* ``Nbr of desired modules``: The number of modules that are desired in the last deployment.

### Last deployment

The last deployment section shows information about the deployment manifest that is currently applied to the IoT Edge device.

### IoT Edge Module

The IoT Edge module section represents the modules that are currently deployed on the IoT Edge device. It doesn't include the system modules of IoT Edge (edgeAgent and edgeHub).
With the portal, the user can interact with these modules and manage them (Get last module logs, restart module, etc.).

### Device Twin tags

To store additional information about the device, the application uses device twin tags.

| Name    	| Position     	| Description                                                                                                                                 	|
|---------	|--------------	|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Environment 	| ``tags.env`` 	| Field that contains the Device Environment value.<br>_**note**: this tag may be used to target deployment manifests for the IoT Edge_ 	|
| Type 	| ``tags.type`` 	| Field that contains The type of the IoT Edge device.<br>_**note**: this tag may be used to target deployment manifests for the IoT Edge_ 	|

### DPS Enrollment groups

The IoT Hub portal relies on Azure Device Provisioning Enrollement groups to manage IoT Edge device connection strings.
When clicking on "*Connect*" in the IoT Edge details page, the user can access the device unique credentials in the enrollment group.

> Note: see [Provision the device with its cloud identity
](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-provision-devices-at-scale-linux-symmetric?view=iotedge-2020-11&tabs=individual-enrollment%2Cubuntu#provision-the-device-with-its-cloud-identity) to know how to configure the IoT Edge to use these credentials to connect to the platform.

## IoT Edge Configuration

The IoT Edge configuration concerns the IoT Edge deployment manifests that are currently present in the IoT Hub.
The portal can be used to see the details of the configurations. 

> Note: At this time the portal cannot be used to update the configurations.

![./assets/images/edge-configuration.png](./assets/images/edge-configuration.png)

### Target

The parameters are related to the IoT Edge deployment manifest target condition field.
The IoT Hub portal will use the Target condition to extract this values from the deployment manifest.

| Name        	| Position       	| Description                                              	|
|-------------	|----------------	|----------------------------------------------------------	|
| Owner       	| ``tags.owner`` 	| Owner tag filter condition from the Deployment Manifest. 	|
| Environment 	| ``tags.env``   	| Environment tag filter from the Deployment Manifest.     	|
| Type        	| ``tags.type``  	| Device type tag filter from the Deployment Manifest. Expected value for IoT Edge LoRaWAN LNS is `LoRa Network Server`, otherwise the value must be `Other`     	|

## Enrollment groups

The IoT Hub portal relies on Azure Device Provisioning Enrollement groups to manage IoT device connection credentials.

For each device model, the portal will create a new enrollment group with symmetric key attestation. By clicking on "*Connect*" in the device details page, the portal will show unique credentials to the device for the corresponding enrollment group.

Furthermore, the enrollment group is configured to provide initial device twin state: 

```json
{
  "tags": {
    "modelId": "......"
  },
  "properties": {
    "desired": {}
  }
}
```

For more information, see [Azure Device Provisioning Enrollement groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/concepts-symmetric-key-attestation?tabs=windows#group-enrollments).

# LoRaWAN

LoRaWAN features are activated by default, providing a way to configure IoT Devices that supports LoRaWAN connectivity in the Portal.
Internally, the LoRaWAN connectivity is expected to be provided by [IoTEdge LoRaWAN StarterKit](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge-lorawan-starterkit/). The IoT Hub portal will manage devices by modifying their twin properties to make them working with this solution.

> Note: to disable LoRa Features, change the value of ``LoRaFeature__Enabled`` to false in the Portal App Settings.

## [Device models](#lorawan-device-models)

For regular Device Models the IoT hub portal provides the possibility to manage LoRaWAN device models.
To activate the LoRaWAN features on the device model, the user have to enable the option in the `LoRa Device` section

![./assets/images/lora-feature-device-model-toggle.png](./assets/images/lora-feature-device-model-toggle.png)

> Note: once activated, the device model detail adds a new tab called "LORAWAN" that adds new settings to the device model.

![./assets/images/lora-device-model.png](./assets/images/lora-device-model.png)

### Parameters

The parameters for the device models are parameters that are stored in the IoT Hub portal and retrieved for devices that inherits from this device model.

> Note: At this time, some of these settings are not automatically changed on devices when changed to the device model. Only commands will be automatically available on device details after the model modification.
>
> In that case, user should then modify each device and re-save it to get the correct properties.

* ``OTAA AppEUI``: The device model OTAA App EUI used for the device during the OTAA Join procedure.
* ```Sensor Decoder URL```: The Sensor Decoder URL that the network server should use to decode frames comming from the devices that inherit from this model.

### Commands

The devices commands are pre-stored frames that the user can add to the device model and then will be able to use on the device detail page to launch to the device.

* ``Name``: The command name. This name is only a friendly name that the user can set to understand what the command is supposed to do.
* ```Frame```: The LoRaWAN frame (in hex) to be sent to the device.

## [Devices](#lorawan-devices)

LoRaWAN devices are accessible from the IoT Hub portal for devices that inherits from the LoRaWAN device model.
The LoRaWAN tab shows the device details.

![./assets/images/lora-device-details.png](./assets/images/lora-device-details.png)

> Note: By selecting the correct device model on the first tab, the portal will automatically take LoRaWAN settings from the device model to apply on the device.

## Concentrators

### Concentrator Tags

To store additional information about the concentrator, the application will use the target device to extract values:

| Name    	| Position     	| Description                                                                                                                                 	|
|---------	|--------------	|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Device Name 	| ``tags.deviceName`` 	| Field that contains the Device name. 	|
| Region 	| ``tags.loraRegion`` 	| Field that contains the Device region. 	|
| deviceType 	| ``tags.deviceType`` 	| Field that contains The type of device. Expected value is `LoRa Concentrator`  |

## Command Execution

To execute the command, the device should have joined the network. The message below explains that the device have to be connected to the network ant commands are disabled until the device is connected to the network.

> See [https://azure.github.io/iotedge-lorawan-starterkit/2.0.0/quickstart/#cloud-to-device-message](https://azure.github.io/iotedge-lorawan-starterkit/2.0.0/quickstart/#cloud-to-device-message) for more information about the Cloud To Device Message involed  in the LoRa WAN device commands execution flow.

## Automatic device configuration for LoRa WAN

When modifying the device model, the IoT Hub portal will automatically create a new Device Configuration that will target the IoT devices that have the corresponding ``modelId`` tag.

The IoT Hub portal will create a new Rollout deployment that will remove older configuration and add the new configuration.

This process ensure that the devices twin will be updated at scale by the IoT hub and each devices that inherit for the model will be updated according the model configuration.

The configuration will be created with the following schema:

```json
{
    "id": "<model-name>-<timestamp>",
    "schemaVersion": "1.0",
    "labels": {
        "created-by": "Azure IoT hub Portal"
    },
    "content": {
        "deviceContent": {
            "properties.desired.AppEUI": "<The Device Model OTAA AppEUI>",
            "properties.desired.SensorDecoder": "<The Device Model Sensor Decoder>"
        }
    },
    "targetCondition": "tags.modelId = '<The model identifier>'",
    "createdTimeUtc": "2022-02-28T20:29:39.128Z",
    "lastUpdatedTimeUtc": "2022-02-28T20:29:39.128Z",
    "priority": 0
}
```
Please note that the ``created-by`` label is used to identify the configuration created by the IoT Hub portal.
